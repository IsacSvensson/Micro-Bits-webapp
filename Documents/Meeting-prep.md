## Meeting 1 - 2020-09-10, 15:45
* What, how and by who will this app be used by? And in what purpose.
* How do you want the MB to be connected to the host? Bluetooth or USB?
* Do you want a frequent update on the values, or do you want to request it when accessing the monitoring app?
    * If frequent, what update interval
* Do you want to save previous result in a database/file?
    * If so, how long history do you want to save?
    * Do you want a history diagram?
* Is the app only reading one MB or multiple?
    * If multiple, do you want the average value to be shown or all the values separately
* Do you want any API’s to connect to if you want to connect something to the app?
* Is it relevant with allowed intervals of the result (e.g. Temp can be 19 – 24 degrees otherwise some action is taken)
* Do you prefer me to work within any special framework?
* Am I supposed to create the web-app from ground up including server?
    * Any special webserver framework?
