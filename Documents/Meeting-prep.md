## Meeting 1 - 2020-09-10, 15:45
* What, how and by who will this app be used by? And in what purpose.

Used by Wahleed, just to monitor temperature.
* How do you want the MB to be connected to the host? Bluetooth or USB?

Up to me as a developer
* Do you want a frequent update on the values, or do you want to request it when accessing the monitoring app?
    * If frequent, what update interval

Preferably every second.
* Do you want to save previous result in a database/file?
    * If so, how long history do you want to save?

2 -4 weeks, high and low of the day

* Is the app only reading one MB or multiple?
    * If multiple, do you want the average value to be shown or all the values separately

Start with one and then add the posibility to add more, both avrg. and separate values.
* Is it relevant with allowed intervals of the result (e.g. Temp can be 19 – 24 degrees otherwise some action is taken)

Yes, but not specified yet.
* Do you prefer me to work within any special framework?

Coding should be in python, but framework is optional
